For example, we need to do the square root of a number or square of a number or permutation from a set of numbers. So, instead doing these tasks from scratch, we can use the MATH library to do these tasks for us. This helps us to focus on the much broader tasks that we are asked to do. For data science work, a very common and useful library is **pandas**. In our next sections, we will use both **pandas** and **dataframes** and see how they work."
